# Vendor Unit Price Plus
A World of Warcraft: Classic 4.4.0+ (Cataclysm) addon that displays the individual unit price of stacked items.

Vendor Unit Price Plus continues the success from Wrath's VendorPricePlus addon. However, because 4.4.0 Cataclysm client includes the stack value when not at a vendor natively, sometimes doing the math for the individual unit price is preferred. This is where this particular addon proves its value.

<h4>Features</h4>

- Includes the vendor price per unit in the tooltip
- Integrates seamlessly with the default Blizzard UI
- Supports World of Warcraft: Classic 4.4.0+ (Cataclysm)
